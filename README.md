Ordinary exam and re-examination:
The examination consists of a take-home assignment on a topic of the studentâ€™s choice and a related practical product.

The assignment can be written individually or in groups of up to 4 students. Group assignments must be written in such a way that the contribution of each student, except for the introduction, thesis statement and conclusion, can form the basis of individual assessment. The assignment should clearly state which student is responsible for which section.
